# Stock Data Time Series Forecasting

An efficient and comprehensive time series forecasting project for Amazon stock price prediction using multiple advanced models including LSTM, GRU, ARIMA, and ensemble methods.
It combines both traditional models like ARIMA and advanced deep learning models such as LSTM, GRU, and Bidirectional LSTM. An ensemble approach is also included to boost performance by combining predictions from multiple models.

The codebase is designed with modularity, scalability, and performance in mind. It features a well-structured architecture where components like data processing, model training, configuration, and evaluation are clearly separated. This makes it easy to understand, extend, and maintain.
